      <description>This was part of an assignment for my CS215 class. It involved coding a maze that uses recursion to randomly generate the maze. For extra credit I went nuts and added DirectX support so I could have the whole thing drawn in 3D.</description>

      <description>The virtual high school or Windsor High school map was a project I did in my senior year for school. (2005) My goal was to create the whole school in a 3d environment which could be explored in the Half-Life 2 game engine. I figured the project would take between 80 and 100 hours. It ended up taking over 200 hours. This was a great learning experience for me. While it did end up taking me so long to do it, I enjoyed almost every minute of it.</description>

      <description>First you need Steam. http://www.steampowered.com Then you need to either buy a copy of Half-Life 2 or The Orange Box to run the mod. This can be picked up retail for between 20 and 50 dollars. It can also be purchased directly from steam.
To install copy the &amp;ldquo;Virtual High School&amp;rdquo; folder (copy the folder that is in the same folder as the readme.txt file. Don&amp;rsquo;t copy the dated folder.) to your SourceMods folder in your steam directory.</description>

      <description>I made this map because I found out a funny way to make a lightsabers. This is still a beta and has a few glitches but please give me your input on what you think of the map, and any ideas to go with it. I hope you enjoy this map. I know my friends and I did.

      <description>This is a map made after one of my favorite Counter-Strike 1.6 maps fy_iceworld. The only difference is I added a little twist to the map for a little more crazy. DANGER ALL GLASS CAN EVENTUALLY BE BROKEN! (Except for the Outer 6 Walls)
