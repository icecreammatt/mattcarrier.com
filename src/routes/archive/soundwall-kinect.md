During my summer internship at <a title="Vertigo" href="http://vertigo.com/" target="_blank">Vertigo</a> I got the opportunity to program using the new Kinect for Windows SDK. I worked on the project with <a title="Leslie Prince" href="http://leslieprince.com/" target="_blank">Leslie Prince</a> under the direction of Mike Moser, and Mike Hanley.
